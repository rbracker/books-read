# books-read

## Introduction
As part of my New Year's resolution for 2024, I set out to read 10 books. So far, I've surpassed that goal and have read 20 books this year! Now, I'm on the hunt for new recommendations to expand my reading list.

The purpose of this webpage is to showcase the books I’ve read this year and to invite visitors to recommend books they enjoyed. Your suggestions are greatly appreciated, and I can’t wait to explore new stories based on your recommendations! You can also visit my other website, the [**Book Survey Form**](https://rbracker.github.io/book-survey/), linked at the bottom of my Books I Have Read webpage to share your favorite reads!

Thank you in advance for your time and thoughtfulness!
